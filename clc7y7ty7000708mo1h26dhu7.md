# Using the Go cobra framework

The Go cobra framework is a great tool that can be used to write command-line interfaces in golang. It is used by many different organisations and projects because of how easy and simple it is to use.

Using it is simple. You just need to run

```go
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra
```

in your terminal. This'll install the cobra library and all the associated dependencies. The `-u` flag will make sure that the dependencies are taken care of.

In your go code, you'll need to import the library by writing:

`import "github.com/spf13/cobra"`

## Working with arguments

Let's create a sample program where we define a command that accepts your name as an argument and prints it out.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func main() {
	PrintName := &cobra.Command{
		//This shows how to run your command
		Use: "print <name>",
		//This shows a short description of your command
		Short: "Prints your name to the console",
		//This is the function that will run when your command gets executed
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			fmt.Printf("Hello, %s\n", args[0])
		},
	}

	var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{Use: "app"}
	rootCmd.AddCommand(PrintName)
	rootCmd.Execute()
}
```

Now to build this program as a binary, you could run `go build` to get the binary under your current directory or run `go install` to build the binary and store it under the `/bin` folder for it to be discoverable by the shell in the `PATH`.

I'll go ahead and place the binary under my current directory as I'll be using it temporarily. I'll run `go build -o app`. Here, the `-o` is a flag for specifying the name of the executable.

I now run the following command in the terminal,`./app print abhi` to get the desired message `Hello, abhi`.

The next part's about flags. We'll do the same thing we did above but instead of passing our name as an argument, we'll do it as a flag.

## Working with flags

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func main() {
	PrintName := &cobra.Command{
		Use: "print",
		Short: "Prints your name to the console",
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			name, _ := cmd.Flags().GetString("name")
			fmt.Printf("Hello, %s\n", name)
		},
	}

	PrintName.Flags().StringP("name", "n", "", "The name of the person to greet")

	var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{Use: "app"}
	rootCmd.AddCommand(PrintName)
	rootCmd.Execute()
}
```

Here, we've added a flag to our command `PrintName` using the `Flags().StringP()` method. What this method does is accept a flag of the type `string` along with other parameters like the name of the flag, shorthand name, default value and a short description. What this function does is return a **pointer** to the string variable that stores the value of the flag.

We then access the flag value using the `Flags().GetString()` method which takes in the flag name (`name` in this case) and returns the string value and error if any. There are different methods for different value types.

Lastly, we print the name using the `fmt.Printf` method.

Next, we build the binary via `go build -o app` and then run `./app print --name abhi` in the terminal and we successfully get the output: `Hello, abhi`

Great, so in this blog we learnt how to build commands using the cobra framework and add flags to it. I say

> Great success
